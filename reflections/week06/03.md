2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
    Looking at the diagram and reading some of this, its hard for me to say since I still don't fully understand it, but i'm gonna have to guess when using v-for's and rendering a post and deleting it from the API.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

    We use them them to access or modify the DOM of your component before or after the initial render.
