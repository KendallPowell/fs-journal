# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    I struggled this entire week with Auth0 and some things within Vue..
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    On thursday working in partner programming I was able to start understanding how vue worked.
- What are you struggling with?
    Mostly with Vue itself, drawing components and where to put them and where to write functions, but also some of the stuff within vue are different from MVC coding.
- What would you count as a victory?
    Just getting the checkpoint to a spot where I think its a passable grade, maybe not a duck, but I'm hoping I won't fail..
