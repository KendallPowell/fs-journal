# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    This week I feel like I am getting back into the swing of waking up early and being able to focus on the lesson and really work on the afternoon projects.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    Being able to use set up photos as backgrounds anywhere on the page.
- What are you struggling with?
    In general I feel like I'm struggling with setting up pages on html and css, but I do feel like I am getting the hang of it.
- What would you count as a victory?
    I would count just getting done with the first checkpoint as a victory.
