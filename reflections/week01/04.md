## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
Wire-framing has three purposes: 
    1.it keeps the concept user-focused so designers to gauge how the user interacts with the interface.

    3.they're quick and cheap to create so clients can build sketches and first drafts to show what they want. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Three different levels of detail
    1.low-fidelity - very basic, rough-draft, usually without sense of scale, grid, or pixel-accuracy. Good for deciding navigation and mapping user flow.
    2.mid-fidelity - most common, usually more accurate representations of layouts. Useful for setting more detailed components and features.
    3.high-fidelity - good for specific layouts and exploring complex concepts.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think they are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort because it helps design and coordinate projects a client want built or get an idea of what they want.
