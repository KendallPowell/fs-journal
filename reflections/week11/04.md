## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This Course and all the people involved are amazing and super helpful, my main concern is finishing the final and graduating and getting a job after. I'm hoping i can just keep looking at PostMan and keep working towards doing whats needed on there and that keeps me focused. One of the most enjoyable things about this course has been the people involved and the students in my Cohort, i'm not a huge fan of people, but every has been super chill and very helpful in showing each other a thing or two as we learn it.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
  If postman fails to login and test data, as I found out today it can happen... it derails my motivation and I need to make sure I can get it right back to where it needs to be to get large projects done.
