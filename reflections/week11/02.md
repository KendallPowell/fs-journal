## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
  Primary Key - focuses on the stuff on a table
  Foreign Key - builds a relationship between the two tables

2. What is an `Alias`?
  Its given to a method or class from a namespace for the sake of clarification in code.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT
d.id,
p.*
FROM doctorsPatients dp,
JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId,
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.patientId
