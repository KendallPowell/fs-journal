# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week? working on allspice and working on the stuff i needed to get done on the backend.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise? backend for the most part isn't super complicated, it just has a lot going on.
- What are you struggling with? making sure my focus stays on one thing at a time to get what i'm working on done.
- What would you count as a victory? making it to the final week of the course.. I had a lot of doubt in myself and saw myself failing the course and not being able to graduate, but i've been able to duck every checkpoint and have slowly built up a little confidence in myself while meeting some really cool people along the way.
