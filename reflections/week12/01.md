# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going?
  Today was stressful.. Over the weekend my internet was not working and I coded Sunday without being able to test my background so it was a lot of debugging.
- Are you managing your stress?
  For the most part I feel confident.
- What has you most worried?
  Getting the backend done, I feel like I'm struggling with it.
