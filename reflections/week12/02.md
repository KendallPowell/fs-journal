# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going?
  Today went well, I got my debugging from yesterday done and was able to keep working on getting the back end done.
- Are you managing your stress?
  As much as I can.
- What has you most worried?
  Still getting the backend done soon, I feel behind because I wanted to be done with it by sunday night..
