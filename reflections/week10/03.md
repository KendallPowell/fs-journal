## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
  The information in a row will be a set of complete objects like a house or car, where a column would be information of that object, such as how many rooms or bathrooms in a house or what make or model a car is.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
  CREATE TABLE characters(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name string NOT NULL,
    age int NOT NULL,
    description string NOT NULL
  )

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; this deletes the specified data from the table.
DROP TABLE table_name; this deletes or "drops" all the data from the table.
```
