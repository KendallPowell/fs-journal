## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
    Value - this holds a data value within its own memory space
    Reference - this doesn't store its values directly, instead this stores the address where the value is being stored
    Pointer - this declaration takes two forms in CSharp, they don't inherit from objects and no conversions

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
    bool / byte / char / decimal / double / enum / float / int / long / sbyte / short / struct / uint / ulong / ushort
    there are A LOT more value types in Csharp

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    Reference stores its data into a cloud where value types are direct and can move around without affecting the variables in another method.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I'm still learning Csharp and I keep getting weird errors and will probably be working a lot on taking notes as Mick does his lectures.
