# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    I started off really bad and just got lost and felt like I wasn't gonna be able to understand all of this weeks material, but on thursday I was surprised to see that I was starting to understand what I was looking at with all the folders in our projects.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    capsulation, after I really started working with it and watching the lectures throughout the week, it started to make sense.
- What are you struggling with?
    I'm still struggling with the capsulation, but it is starting to make sense and I'm starting to understand how it all works.
- What would you count as a victory?
    being able to finish my checkpoint and feel confidant about it.
