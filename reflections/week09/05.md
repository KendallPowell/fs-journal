# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    We ended up getting as far as we wanted in our Capstone and got it functional.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
    Sometimes developers, and it might be rare, but they will gut a whole page and rewrite all the functionality and styling to better suit what they want it to look like.
- What are you struggling with?
    Being able to say that something works and just because it isn't built how someone else wants it to look doesn't mean it needs to be redone.
- What would you count as a victory?
    Getting the capstone to a spot that the whole group was happy with.
