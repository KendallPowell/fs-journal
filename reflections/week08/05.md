# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    Working within the group and making sure everyone was on the same page.

- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    Working within a group can actually make things slightly difficult and slow things down in certain areas I didn't expect it to.

- What are you struggling with?
    I want to learn how to write PostMan tests, and for them to be as effective as Mick's that he used on the checkpoint.

- What would you count as a victory?
    Getting a lot of work done within the week on the Capstone.
