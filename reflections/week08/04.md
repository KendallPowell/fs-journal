## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
    unit testing -  allow individual units of code to be tested in isolation
    component testing - framework agnostic concept to test each component on the DOM
    end to end testing - what happens when users actually use the application

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
    E2E - because it shows what happens when the user uses the application and lets you work on the stuff that they deemed vital

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
    i dont think if i could say any of these are useless but i think the unit testing might be a redundant source since you can component test
