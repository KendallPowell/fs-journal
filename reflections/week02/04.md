## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
    When you make a plan you can better understand the code you need to be writing, instead of just starting to write and adjusting it constantly to get a look you like.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
    I re-read code from previous labs and lectures throughout the week, and sometimes the weeks before.
    Also asking the amazing TA's and Instructors

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
    Plan small steps and accomplish these, then start to do more after, But never spend time planning everything, because that can just be a waste of time.
