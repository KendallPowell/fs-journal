## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    Console.log() - you should use these often when testing any functions to make sure they work.
    Console.error('error.message) - this prints an error from the API

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    Elements Tab - this helps by showing you where in your code there is a mess up that makes the screen off set,
     and can also adjust the CSS and classes so you can test before just applying it and checking it in your HTML and Style.css


3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    Using the Source tab to directly edit or add code to see it in real time
