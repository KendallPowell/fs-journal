# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    Dealing with the APIs and using them.
- What did you learn as a shock or surprise?
    Most popular data, such as pokemon info, is stored for public use and not just stuff you have to hard code or write out yourself.
- What are you struggling with?
    Drawing certain elements and ID's to do certain things, such as drawing an image to a page from an api like in the checkpoint.
- What would you count as a victory?
    Not super struggling with the checkpoint or the projects that we worked on this week.
