## Questions

    1.Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
    2.Resolved: Completed Promise
    3.Rejected: Failed Promise

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
    The main thing is we can attach a callback to a promise rather than passing it.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
